Well, despite our best efforts, sometimes things go wrong.

# Troubleshooting Devices

## The armor vest doesn't turn on or light up.

Make sure the battery is securely in place.

Make sure the battery is charged and turned on. The power bank batteries need to be turned on first; there is a small button near the charging port. When you press the button on the power bank, the color will indicate how much charge is left:

Green: full charge
Yellow: some charge
Red: needs to charge

## The armor vests just displays a string of white pixels.

This means the device isn't connecting to the hub. See the next question.

## The armor vest doesn't connect to the Hub.

Make sure the WiFi settings (SSID/network name and password) are correct. They can be changed in config mode.

Make sure the IP address of the hub server is correct. This can be changed in config mode.

Make sure there aren't any firewall or network settings blocking access between the armor vest and the hub server.

## The armor vest keeps rebooting.

## The coin-op/card-swipe device isn't working.

Make sure the device is connecting to the network.

Make sure the pulse settings are correct. These can be changed in config mode.

## The armor vest displays two red and two white pixels.

The device is in config mode. Make sure the button for config mode isn't pressed and restart the device by removing and re-inserting the battery.

## The armor vest keeps turning off.

To help preserve batteries, the devices turn off automatically after long periods of inactivity. The amount of time passed before the vests go to sleep can be configured.

# Troubleshooting PCs

## The PC just shows a blank screen.

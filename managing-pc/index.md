The MagneTag PC is the computer running the MagneTag Hub. The system runs on top of Windows.

Normally, the PC boots directly into the MagneTag Shell. The MagneTag Shell is essentially an embedded web browser that runs the display client. It runs without any other Windows software running, ensuring that only MagneTag is running on the PC.

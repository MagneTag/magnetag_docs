MagneTag's kiosk mode is designed to be self-service. It's easy enough that your customers can use the system on their own without staffing. There are a few screens that users go through to start playing a game.

Kiosk mode can be operated with free play, where there's no cost to play games. It can also use a credit-based system, where players must swipe a game card, pay with a credit card, or insert coins/bills to play.

## Splash Screen

Initially, the system shows the splash screen, showing videos of people playing the game. Users can touch the screen to continue.

## Options Screen

If you have more than two vests, the Options screen is displayed, letting the user choose how many players they want.

**_Credits mode_**: If game play isn't free, this screen displays the cost of the game or instructions on how to start ("Swipe a card", "Insert $1.00", etc.).

## Ready Screen

Next, the players should put on their armor vests. Once each team is ready, they should touch the button on the screen that says their team is ready. (If they touch the button again, it resets to the unready state.)

**_Credits mode_**: If game play isn't free, this screen displays the cost of the game or instructions on how to start ("Swipe a card", "Insert $1.00", etc.). The game won't begin until credits have been paid.

## Game

After a short countdown, the game begins.

## Return Armor Vests Screen

After the game has finished, players are instructed to return their armor vests and press a button once they're done. Once they press that button, the system returns to the Splash screen.
